Overview.

Tracking your baby’s weight is one of the easiest ways to ensure your little one is progressing at a proper pace. It can also be a good indication of potential health issues. While your doctor will check your baby’s weight during regular check-ups, this isn’t a very convenient method if you are busy parents who want to keep a close eye on your baby’s development, especially if there have been problems in the past. With a baby scale at home, you can check your baby’s weight whenever you would like. 

A quality Abellio baby scale can not only make the process of measuring and monitoring a baby’s weight easy and quick, but also deliver accurate and reliable results. The Abellio scales can be used separately or with the related mobile application: MyWeigh Baby.  

If you would like to connect your digital baby scales with an attendant application it will provide you with a variety of functionality: 

Weighting with the hold function; 
Displaying different metrics ways; 
Storing a measured weight and comparing it to the next weight weighed; 
Tracking scaling; 
Leading control for more than one baby;
Sharing the measured weight details.
